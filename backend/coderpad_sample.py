FHIR Healthcare Data Query Challenge

Description:
This exercise involves working with healthcare data in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format.
You'll be implementing functions to load and query FHIR resources such as Patients, Encounters, and Medication Requests.

Tasks:
1. Complete the implementation of data loading functions
2. Implement query functions to search and filter FHIR resources

Sample data:
- The code works with sample FHIR data provided as JSON files
- You can assume these files are in the same directory as this script
